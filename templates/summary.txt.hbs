This below content primarily focused on representing a subset of files from a local directory or repository. It also includes a section outlining the directory structure (respecting exclusions) and a summary of statistical information about the scanned files. The statistics cover the count, total size, and average size for each file type encountered.

The core of the file is dedicated to presenting the content of individual files selected based on the configuration below. Files are delimited by '''--- {relative_path} ---''', indicating the file's path relative to the repository root. The file's content follows immediately after its path and continues until the next '''--- End of {relative_path} ---''' sequence.

Help me gain a deeper understanding of the design and structure of this project, which I will continue to develop based on this project.
